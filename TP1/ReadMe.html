    <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
    <h4>What is the impact of early Computer Art in the present time ?</h4>
    <p>
        Learning to program allows us to think in new ways. 
        It raise new questions, new reflexions and even comparison between our society and programming.

    <ul>
        <li>What have you produced?</li>
        <p>A ball with different caracteristics when we press the mouse. It can give a "ghost" effect, change the size or change the color.</p>
        
        <li>
            How would you describe your first independent coding experience (in relation to
        thinking, reading, copying, modifying, writing code, and so on)?
        </li>
        <p>It was an exciting experience, especially when we can have a graphic result, 
            a little bit less funny for me when we need to optimize our code</p>

        <li>
            How is the coding process different from, or similar to, reading and writing text?
        </li>
        <p>
            For both, we need to think ahead before writing if we want to be efficient.<br>
            Also, we can have tools to correct us when we write something incorrectly. <br>
            Contrary to writing text, we can run each step of our coding process to know if we write it correctly.<br>
            We can do some experiment with code.
        </p>

        <li>
            What does code and programming mean to you, 
            and how does the assigned reading help you to further reflect on these terms?
        </li> 
        <p>
            I consider code and programming as a tool to achieve some of my personnal project.<br>
            The assigned reading make me sceptical because : 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    We already have some notion about programming thanks to the last semester 
                    so I think that some part of this chapter don't concern us. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    That hasn't changed my interpretation of code and programming.<br>
                    If I hasn't reading this text, I would never think that some people can have this kind of interpretation. <br>
                    I think that it's a very anthropocentrism interpretation, far different from my own interpretation. <br>
                    It's intriguing but I have some difficulty to understand sometime.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
